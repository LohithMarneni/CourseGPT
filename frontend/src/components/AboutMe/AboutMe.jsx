            This project was built as part of my application for the{" "}
            <strong>Kalvium Internship Drive 2025</strong>, where I was tasked
            with developing <strong>CourseGPT</strong> â€” an AI-powered course
            authoring platform designed to assist educators in efficiently
            creating and organizing high-quality learning material.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            <strong>CourseGPT</strong> simplifies educational content creation
            using AI-generated lessons, intelligent templates, and module
            organization tools. It addresses key challenges such as content
            consistency, structural coherence, and scalable course development.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Core features include a lesson generator, smart module structuring,
            and an intuitive editor for refining content. The platform was built
            using <strong>React.js</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and
            integrated with <strong>AI APIs</strong> and a RESTful backend.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            A functional prototype was deployed with documentation and a project
            presentation highlighting key learnings and contributions.
